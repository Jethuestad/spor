Breaking: This removes the "t-shirt size" spacing design tokens, and replace them with pixel values.

In other words, the new tokens are `3`, `6`, `9`, `12`, `18`, `24` and so on - reflecting their pixel values.

To migrate, please go through all places you use spacing tokens and replace them with new values.
