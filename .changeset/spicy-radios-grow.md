Add a whole new range of reds

This change introduces all the inbetween colors in the red range. Where we previously had Red 600 and Red 50, we now have all colors in between.

Note that palette.red.50 is renamed to palette.red.100. You probably should be using aliases, but if you haven't for some reason, this will be a breaking change you'll have to address.
