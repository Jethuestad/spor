# Layout (React)

The layout package consists of all the components you need to layout your applications.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @vygruppen/spor-layout-react
```

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  Box,
  Center,
  Container,
  Divider,
  Flex,
  Grid,
  GridItem,
  HStack,
  SimpleGrid,
  Spacer,
  Stack,
  VStack,
  Wrap,
  WrapItem,
} from "@vygruppen/spor-layout-react";
```

All of these components are direct exports from Chakra UI. Please refer to their documentation for details.

One exception is the `Divider` component. It's used on its own, and accepts any `BoxProps`.
