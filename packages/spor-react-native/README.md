# Spor (React Native)

This package includes everything you need to build a Vy-themed React Native app. It's built with TypeScript, but you can use it with JavaScript if you want.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @vygruppen/spor-react-native
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { SporProvider } from "@vygruppen/spor-react-native";
```

First, wrap app in the `<SporProvider />` component. This will provide the rest of the Spor components with a theme and a language preference.

Once that's done, you can use all components available.

## Development

Please refer to the root readme for development notes.
