# Bottom-Drawer (React Native)

Bottom drawers are modals which lay on top of other content and are always rooted to the bottom of the view.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @vygruppen/spor-bottom-drawer-react-native
```

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  SimpleDrawer,
  BottomDrawer,
  DrawerHeader,
  DrawerFooter,
} from "@vygruppen/spor-bottom-drawer-react-native";
```

`<SimpleDrawer />` is a simple drawer with a title and text content. There are three props `size`, `textAlign` and `title`.

`<BottomDrawer />` provides more options for customizations. Can import `DrawerHeader` and `DrawerFooter` in addition to other Spor-components.
