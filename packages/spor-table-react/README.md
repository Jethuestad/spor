# Table (React)

This package includes all the components you need to create nice-looking tables.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @vygruppen/spor-table-react
```

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  Table,
  TableCaption,
  Thead,
  Tbody,
  Tfoot,
  Tr,
  Th,
  Td,
} from "@vygruppen/spor-table-react";
```

These components are used the same way as in Chakra UI. Please refer to [their documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/data-display/table).

In the future, you'll also find some extra features, like sortable tables, a `SimpleTable` etc.
