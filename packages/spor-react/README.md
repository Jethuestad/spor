# Spor React Component library

This package includes everything you need to build your React component library. It's built with TypeScript, but you can use it with JavaScript if you want.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @vygruppen/spor-react
```

## Usage

Import the components and functions you need as named imports:

```tsx
import { Button, Input } from "@vygruppen/spor-react";
```

Each component and function comes with extensive documentation that shows up once you use it. Just hover over the component to make it show up in your IDE. There will also be interactive documentation available online sometime in The Future (tm).

## Development

Please refer to the root readme for development notes.
