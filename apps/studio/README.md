# Sanity Studio

This is the Sanity Studio for the Spor docs website

## Setup

To get started, please make a copy of the `.env.example` file, and name it `.env.development`:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env.development
```

Next, you can install all dependencies by running `npm install` and start a local development server with `npm run dev`. The Sanity studio will open on `localhost:3333`.

If you're an external contributor, you want to create your own Sanity account and get a project ID. You can pass that in via the `sanity.json` file.
